# 2048 Game
## Summary
As part of a Software Development class, I completed a project that involved creating the 2048 game using Java. In addition to coding the game itself, I also learned several key concepts such as the Module Interface Specification, UML Class diagram, Control Flow Chart, and JUnit tests.

The 2048 game features both manual and automatic demos. The manual demo allows users to progress until they reach the number 8, using directional input in the form of up, down, left, or right. The automatic demo progresses through the game until it reaches the number 128, by cycling through the directions randomly.

The game runs in a text-based GUI in the terminal and consists of a 4 x 4 matrix made using a nested array. The objective of the game is to start with two 2s on the board, and with each move, 2s are randomly added to the board. The user must combine the same numbers to double them and ultimately reach the goal number of 2048.
